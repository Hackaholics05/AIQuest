# **AI Quest**  
**AI Quest** is an AI-powered Question Answering (QA) system that leverages advanced machine learning models to fetch, process, and deliver accurate and context-aware answers to user queries. The platform integrates Wikipedia-based knowledge retrieval, FAISS for semantic search, and a T5 transformer for generative answers.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Fetches relevant content directly from Wikipedia.  
- **Semantic Search**: Uses FAISS to retrieve the most relevant paragraphs or sentences.  
- **Generative AI**: T5 model generates detailed and contextual answers.  
- **Future Enhancements**:  
  - Similar question handling and merging solutions.  
  - Integration with advanced LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT).  
  - Feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.  
  - Explainable AI module for transparency.  
  - Dynamic answer fusion for multi-faceted queries.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Machine Learning**: FAISS, Sentence Transformers, T5 Model  
- **Knowledge Source**: Wikipedia API  
- **Database**: MongoDB (planned for logging and history tracking)
